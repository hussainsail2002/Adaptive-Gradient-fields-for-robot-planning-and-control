This is my Master's project @ ASU with IRIS lab. 

The goal of this project is to find ways to create a gradient of a dynamic system whose dynamics is unknown or discontinuous. 
We use a jacobian approximation method to find the linearized dynamics of a non linear dynamic system and solve a simple control problem. 

We are able to show that even if the system is a black box, by sampling the forward rollout of the system we can get the gradient and optimize the controls.
